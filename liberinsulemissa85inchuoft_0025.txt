the church. The family of Stratherne were the only Scotch subjecta who
could claim the distinction of having founded a bishopric and inheriting its
patronage, unless we except the great lords of Galloway‚ who appear to
have renewed the foundation of the venerable see of St N inian.¹

Whether we adopt Fordun’s authority, and hold it as certain that the see
of Dunblane was founded by Earl Gilbert, who succeeded in 1171 and
died in 1223, or ascribe its erection to a somewhat earlier period, it might
be an inquiry of some interest to endeavour to ascertain from what dio-
ceses the territory assigned to the new see was disjoined. It is not pro-
bable that the old bishopric of Cumbria extended at any time further to
the northward than the limits of the later diocese of Glasgow, which appear
on all sides to have been marked out by the ancient boundaries of the
British people of Strathclyde and Reged. The see of St Andrews may
probably have contributed a portion of its south-western territory to the
new bishopric, but it seems likely that the great bulk of its jurisdiction
was derived from the diocese of Dunkeld.³

of the 13th century, the whole diocese of
Lismore, or Argyll, was included within its
bounds.-(800ticlaron. VI. xl. xli.--“ In illo

Mylp, with the recorda of the cathedral still
entire, writes that in the episcopato ‚of Wil-
liam St Clair, Bishop of Dunkeld during the
reign of Robert Bruce, Finlay elected Abbot
of Y, received episcopal confirmation from him
as his ordinary, at his palaee of Tybermuir.
(Vit. Ept'w. Dunk. p. 13.) The continuator
of Fordun relates that in the year 1431,
the Abbot of Icolmkil did obeisance (fecit
obedientiam) to Robert Bishop of Dunkeld.
We may account for this seeming anomaly‚
which placed one of the Western Islea within
a diocese from which it was separated by so
great adistance‚ and by so many natural bar-

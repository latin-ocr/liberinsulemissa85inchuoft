was provided on the 26th of November 1553, with the abbacy of Inchaffray
in commendam. Next year he was made commendator also of the abbacy
of Icolmkill. In 1558 he was translated from the bishopric of the Isles to
the diocese of Galloway. He was still styled postulate of the Isles in 1561,r ,

In the General Assembly of the Kirk, convened at·Edinburgh the 25th
of December 1567, Alexander, called Bishop of Galloway, commissioner,
was accused, “that he had not visited these three years bygone, the kirks
within his charge3 that he had left off the visiting and planting of kirks,
and he haunted court too much, and had now purchased to be one of the
Session and PrivyCouncil, which cannot agree with the office of a pastor or
bishop3 that he had resigned Inchaffray in favour of a young child, and
set diverse lands in feu, in prejudice of the kirk.'' The Bishop of Galloway
“ granted that he offended in all that was laid to his cha1·ge.’'t

The youth in whose favour he had resigned the Abbacy of Inchaffray,
was James Drummond of Inverpeffray, the second son of David, second
Lord Drummond, who was commendator of Inchaffray on the 13th of March
1556, when David Lord Drummond acted with him as his coadjutor.¹¹
The abbacy of Inchaffray was erected into a temporal lordship in his
favour, and he was created Lord Madertie in 1609. From him is descended

the noble family of Strathallan.

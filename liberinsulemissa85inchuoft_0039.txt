THE PREFACE. · xix

The first part of the fourth consists of an abbreviate of original charters
Ι from the charter-chests of Anthony Murray of Greiff, Esq., and of Alex-
ander Anderson Henry, Esq. of Woodend, to whom the Club is indebted
for their use. The remainder of tho fourth Appendix is an abbrevi-
ation of charters, from a transcript of the originale preserved in the library
at Innerpeffry‚ a foundation of David Lord Madertie. The transcript
is the property of the Maitland Club, to whose members, as well as to the
attentive courtesy of Professor Fleming of Glasgow, the Bannatyne Club

is indebted for its use. ,

marsh for'common benefit. The act which followed upon their petition is
the fifth article of the Appendix. The date, which is erroneously printed
in the title, is correctly given in the body of the Act-—October 9th, 1696.·

two cheverons gules :’' and undoubtedly the Earls Malis of the 13th century
bore that coat‚ as did also their vassals (perhaps too their kinsmen) the
family of the Seneschals of Stratherne, from whom the house of Tulibardin
is descended. On a seal appended to a charter of Malis Earl of Strathernc‚
(printed in the Appendix ιο the Preface, No. 19) the double cheveron is seen
both on the shield and over all the housings of the horse. The pretty seal

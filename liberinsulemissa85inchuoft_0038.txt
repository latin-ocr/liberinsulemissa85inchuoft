xviii THE PREFACE.

narrative of the Papal commission proceeds partly upon his information.
It sets forth that the see had been vacant for above ten years, during
which time its property had been plundered‚ so that no fit person could
be induced to hold the office, until the Papal commissioners had fixed
upon the then Bishop, in the hope that through him the church might
breathe again out of its slough of misery-—that the new bishop had found it
so desolate that he had not where to lay his head in the cathedral. There
was no chapter3 but in ⁵ the unroofed church, a certain rustic chaplain
performed divine service3 while the bishop's revenues were so slender, they
scarce afforded fitting maintenance for half the year. Upon this statement,
the Pope granted commission for assigning to the Bishop, the fourth of the
tithes of the whole parishes of the diocese, from which he was to reserve a
fitting sustenance for himself and to provide for a dean and canons to be
established by the Papal commissioners. Or otherwise, the commissioners
were to assign the fourth of the tithes to the Bishop3 to transfer the epis-
copal see to the monastery of canons regular of St John (of Inchaffray3)
and to constitute the canons the electoral chapter of the diocese.

It is certain that the alternative of raising the convent of Inchaffray into
the chapter of the diocese did not take effect3 and the cathedral continued
to be governed by a secular chapter„ The Papal commission‚ contrary to its
avowed purpose, produced an abandonment by the Bishop of all right of
pension out of the lands or churches of the Earl of Menteth‚ and a per-
mission to the Earl to found a house of Augustinian canons in the Isle of
Inchmahomok, with the churches of Lany and of the isle itself for their
endowment. The church of Kippen was assigned by the Earl to form a
canonry in the cathedral‚ and he made over to the Bishop all right to the
church of Gallendar.

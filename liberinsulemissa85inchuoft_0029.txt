Gilbert appears to have had at least seven sons, Gilchrist‚ William,
Ferthet, Robert, F ergus, Malia, and Gilbert. The marriage of their
daughter Matilda has already been mentioned. Another, Cecilia, married
Walter the son of Alau, the ancestor of the family of Gowrie, and had for
her dower the land of Kulgasc.¹ In his old age the Earl took a second
wife, Ysenda‚ the daughter of a knightly family of the surname of Gasc!

bert’s death—“ Gilbertus fundator canonicorum Insule Missarum et epis-
copatus Dunblanensis obiit Anno Domini 1223.” ¹²

convent, unjustly3 nay, will love and everywhere honour them, as his
most special friends, and will add to the possessione of their house, what-
ever he may, by the counsel of his friends. In particular, he confirms to
them the churches of Gask and Strogeth.

There are several charters in the present Register throwing light upon
the period of Earl Robert and his transactions3 and a few original charters
of his time are added in the Appendix to the Preface.

THE PREFACE.

then, the parents having chosen it as the place of burial of their son, they
recorded their sorrow in an extended foundation, and more liberal endow-
ment of their monastery. The convent was to be of Augustinian canons
regular, of whom a certain Malis the Hermit, in whose piety and discretion
the founders had all confidence, was to be the head, and to have the
selection. The Earl and Gountess declared their affection for the place-
“ so much do we love it, that we have chosen a place of sepulture in it for
us and our successors, and have already buried there our eldest born.” It
was dedicated to St Mary the Virgin and Saint John the Evangelist‚ and
was, by its great charter (of 1200) endowed with the churches of St
Kattanus of Abbyruthven, of St Ethirnanus of Madderty, (the parish
formed out of the Earl's new manor os Madderty, forfeited by Gillecolm),
of St Patrick of. Strogeth‚ of St Mechesseok of Ochterardouer, of St
Beanus of Kynkell3 with the tithe of the Earl's cain and rents of wheat‚
m’eal, malt, cheese, and all provisions used throughout the year in his court3
with tithe of all fish brought into his kitchen, and of the produce of his
hunting; and the tithe of all the profits of his courts of justice, and all,
offerings. The convent had the liberty of fishing in the Peffer, and of
fishing and birding over all the Earl's lands, waters‚ and lakes. They
might take timber, for building and all other uses, from his woods, and
have their pannage, or mast feeding for pigs, as well as bark and fire-
wood, in whatever placeS, and as much as, they chose. Some years later,
Earl Gilbert granted to the canons, now seated at Inchaffray, the church
of St Beanus of Foulis‚ with the ‘ dower’ land of the church, and the
common pasturage of the parish 3¹² and the church of the Holy Trinity of
Gasc, with the same privileges.‘¹ The charter conveying the latter grant
has still appended to it a fragment of the granter’s knightly seal‚ with a
counter-seal of arms, which bears no resemblance to the known cognisance

Ρ charter in the Appendix to Preface. ‘¹ Charter, ibidem.

the ancient Earls of Stratherne. This Register of their abbey affords a
good deal of information regarding them ‘3 and itv is· hoped the original
charters printed in the Appendix may also be found useful in illustrating
this interesting and historica] family. Some of these have a separate and
peculiar interest. ’

The family 'of Stratherne, and its possessions, have been so mixed up
with the romantio events of Scotch history, that they have been naturally
subjected to some exaggeration. The ancient earldom has been described
as including “the haill lands lying betwixt Groce Macduff ‘at Newburgh,
and the west *end of Balquhidder, in length3 the Oichell hills and the hills
called Montes Grampii, in breadthss’* This Register, and the charters
which accompany it, show that there were many independent lords within
that district from the earliest period of record, and almost as early as the
earldom can have been held, at least by that title. We even become
acquainted with a Royal castle of ‘ Earn,’ that strength betrayed by the
traitor Gillecolme ; and it may exercise‘the research of the local antiquary
to fix its site. But with due deduction from the magniloquent descriptions
of our old writers, the possessions of the family were sufficient to give them
a very high place among the great earls of Scotland. It is not, perhaps, to
be hoped that the confusion and obscurity ‘that involve the latter descents
of the ancient family should bc entirely removed, but the documents now
collected may be of some service in such an investigation.W They cannot fail,

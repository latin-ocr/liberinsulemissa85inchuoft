THE PREFAOE.

Tan beautiful valley of Stratherne has some peculial· points of interest
for the Scotch historian and antiquary. It contains, in the forts scattered
over its lower district, and in the remarkable ‘ round tower' of Abernethy‚
among the oldest vestiges of civil dominion and of ecclesiastical antiqui-
ties that remain to us. The Earldom ascends to a high and romantio
antiquity, and it was our only County palatine. Its great Earls, of the
ancient Scotch blood, held their own, amid the innovatione of David 1., as
the leaders of the Celtic party, and supported their native customs against
the new-fangledness of the *Saxon and Norman chivalry·· The older
chroniclers mention them with much of the respect paid to royalty.

Malis was the Count of that time, perhaps the first of the raee who
accepted the new southern title of honour. He was not a man of parch-
ments 3 or at least we have no charters granted to him or by him. He
was one of ,the six Earls who attested or consented to the re-erection of
the abbey of Scone, by King Alexander I.‚ about the year 11143 and he
witnessed another grant to the same monastery 3 ¹' one to the cathedral of
Glasgow,⁰ and several charters of David Ι. to Dunfermline. We know him

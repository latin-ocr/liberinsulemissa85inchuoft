vi THE PREFAGE

Very early in the reign of William (1178-80), Earl Gilbert had a
charter of Kinbethach‚ to be held to him and his heirs, of the King and his
heirs, as freely as he held his earldom os Stratherne.¹‘ Among the witnesses
to that charter is a person styled Gillecolm Marescald. > A few years later
(before 1189) the King granted to Earl Gilbert, Maddyrnin (Madderty),
with all its pertinents, and with all feudal privileges and jurisdictions‚ to be
held for half a knight's service—but under a remarkable condition—“ that
no part of the land should ever be sold to Gillecolme Marescall, or his heirs,
or any one of his race, seeing the said Gillecolm forfeited that land for felony
done against the King, in that he rendered up the King’s castle of HERY'N
vfeloniously‚ and afterwards wickedly and traitorously went over to his

received consecration, even after they were
permitted to take their seats in the Scotch

riers of sea and land, by supposing that when
the Bishops of Dunkeld oeded the western

portion of their territory to the new epis-
copate of Argyll, they reserved Iona to their
own jurisdiction, either on account of the
dignity which attached to an island illus-
trious by so many associations, or by reason
of the especial reverence in which the me·-
mory of Saint Columba was had at Dunkeld,
where it has been supposed that his bones
found a resting-place, and of whose cathedral
church he was the patron saint. It does not
appear that Iona was at any time of old in·
cluded within the Norwegian see of the Isles,
which (perhaps even until the 15th century)

was considered no suffragan of the Scotchv

church, but owed its allegiance to the Arch-
bishop of. Drmitheim, and was acknowledged
to be within his province. In like manner
the see of Gassoway, long after the subjection
of the province in civil things to the crown
of Scotland, was accounted to belong, in spi-
ritual matters, to the province of York, from
whose metropolitan the Bishops of Whitherne

parliament, in the 14th century.

In the famous bull of Pope Innocent 111.
(ΑΒ. 1198-1214) recognising the inde-
pendence of the Scoteh church, only nine
bishoprics were enumerated as within its
limits-St Andrews, Glasgow, Dunkeld,
Dunblane, Brechin, Aberdeen, Moray, Ross,
and Gaithness. (Reyist. Gla-³9. p. 77.) Lis-
more, or Argyll, had not yet been separated
from Dunkeld. Galloway was then acknow-
ledged to be suffragan of York ; and Orkney
and the Isles were, until long afterwards, in the
obedience of the Metropolitan of Drontheim.

Some. apology may seem to be required
for introducing this notice of the jurisdiction
of a few of our ancient bishoprics in this
place. The subject is not without interest,
and the chartularies still remaining to be
published may not afford any opening more
appropriate.

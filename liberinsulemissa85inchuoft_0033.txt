to that charge until the said law of Clan Macduff should have had its
privilege in regard to him thus repledged to its jurisdiction; and he de-

of Stratherne, continued under their protection until the earldom had
merged in the crown, and the bishop and chapter held their lande, annual
rents, and temporalities, of the earls, as their feudal superiors. In 1442
James IL, in Parliament‚ declared the earldom fallen to the crown, and
ordained the bishopric temporalities henceforth to be held in free barony

There is evidence of the privilege of Clan
Macduff having saved Hugh de Arbuthnot and
his accomplices from being proceeded against
for the slaughter of John de Melvil of Glen-
bervy in 1421. (Analect. ὅσοι. II. p. 30.) Α
